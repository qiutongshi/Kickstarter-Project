# Kickstarter-Project
## Introduction
Kickstarter is an intersection between a crowdfunding platform and a retailer. As opposed to the stability of a traditional retail platform, Kickstarter presents significant risks in consumer’s purchases/backing of products that are not yet produced. If consumers are willing to back a product that does not yet exist, without definite guarantee that it will be produced, then projects that get backed on Kickstarter are likely an indication of future trends. Project categories and types that succeed on Kickstarter can be indicative of where physical and online retailers are lacking in products that currently exist, or where demand is unmet. Small companies and upcoming start-ups often use kickstarter as both a way to gain funding for a project, but also gauge interest in a product/idea/project. Retailers can use kickstarter trends as another avenue to determine what to anticipate in the future.  

On an individual level, upcoming Kickstarter project developers would be able to use this information to determine what products they should develop in the future, based on the success rate of others in their field. Using specific terms, as well as catering toward a specific audience may impact the success rate of a project.  

The dataset could be used to find what contributes to a “successful” kickstarter versus a “failed” kickstarter. What “keywords” shows up that greenlight to people that this is a company that they want to back? 

## Data Summary
We obtained data from a website that has an AI that scrapes information from all of kickstarter’s category and subcategory pages monthly, then exports them into CSV and JSON formats and posts them online (Web Robots 2022). The original dataset contains 1,278,789 observations, with over 40 variables of interest.
